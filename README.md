# Configure-the-Internet-router-
**Custom Defence System**

_This is a 24 week project where me with my 4 other fellow school mates are going to work with the client on this project_

**Background**

The Gippsland Portal is a Victorian regional website that aggregates news from
government and semi-governmental organisations for the public. The portal serves
Latrobe City, Baw Baw, Bass Coast, East, South and Wellington Shire councils.Â 
The Gippsland Portal is in the process of building a custom defence system to protect its
news aggregation service from unauthorised access and data scraping.
Unlike existing solution or previously trialed solution by Gippsland Portal, this time we
would like to pursue this in the Network Router Level.

**Project Goal**

Design and Implement a detailed solution on how to configure the Internet router
connected to the website to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data scraping.

**Desired Outcome**

1. Author a design document on what security measures is typically available on
Internet routers.
2. Develop a solution to block unauthorized access and data scraping by IP address
  o What methods can be used to identify what IPs should be blocked
  o How such IP block lists can be implemented on a specific Internet router
